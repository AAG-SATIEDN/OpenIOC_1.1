Major Changes:

1. Restructured the XML. OpenIOC now has thee distinct sections

--metadata
    Description, creator, dates...

--criteria
    Everything that used to be <definition>

--parameters
    Additional section for providing arbitrary metadata on <Indicator> and <IndicatorItem> elements.
    

Removed IOCs requirement to respect Lucene behaviors.

Added additional operators. Including the existing 'is' and 'contains', we now have the following:
The following operators are expected to perform as they are described in XPath 2.0
                String  Md5sum  IPAddr  Integer DateTime
is              yes     yes     yes     yes     yes
contains        yes     
matches         yes             yes     
starts-with     yes     
ends-with       yes     
greater-than    no                      yes     yes
less-than       no                      yes     yes

Moved operator negation out of the operator itself (isnot) to its own attribute IndicatorItem/@negate=true|false

Added case sensitivity IndicatorItem/@preserve-case=true|false

this is how you query
11:57 AM
curl -k -u admin:mandiant "https://localhost/administration/configurator/?key0=agentcontroller/agent_controller/optimization/max_empty_document_size&key1=agentcontroller/agent_controller/optimization/ignore_empty_documents"
11:58 AM
this is how you modify
11:58 AM
curl -X POST -k -u admin:mandiant "https://localhost/administration/configurator/?agentcontroller/agent_controller/optimization/max_empty_document_size=2048&agentcontroller/agent_controller/optimization/ignore_empty_documents=True"
11:58 AM
so you can query multiple configuration values in one request, and you can set multiple configuration values in one PUT

make sense?
