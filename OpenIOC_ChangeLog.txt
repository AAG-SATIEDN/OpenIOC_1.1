Major Changes:

Restructured the XML. OpenIOC now has thee distinct sections

--metadata
    Description, creator, dates...

--criteria
    Everything that used to be <definition>

--parameters
    Additional section for providing arbitrary metadata on <Indicator> and <IndicatorItem> elements.
    

Removed IOCs requirement to respect Lucene behaviors.

Added additional operators. Including the existing 'is' and 'contains', we now have the following:
The following operators are expected to perform as they are described in XPath 2.0
                String  Md5sum  IPAddr  Integer DateTime Bool Float
is              yes     yes     yes     yes     yes      yes  yes
contains        yes     
matches         yes             yes     
starts-with     yes     
ends-with       yes     
greater-than    no                      yes     yes           yes
less-than       no                      yes     yes           yes

Moved operator negation out of the operator itself (isnot) to its own attribute IndicatorItem/@negate=true|false

Added case sensitivity IndicatorItem/@preserve-case=true|false

Added node context to the Indicator/@node-context, allowing us to define document roots.

### OpenIOC 1.1 v2 (addendums)

Added node context `Indicator/@node-context=xs:string`, this will allow for future ability to specify node-context to allow matches that consist of sibling or parent/child nodes that did not evaluate together properly in 1.0.

`IndicatorItem/@id` is now a required item. Previously it was not, allowing for Items to not have ids and still validate.

`IndicatorItem/content` and `IndicatorItem/context` are now `minOccurs=1` -- this prevents items from existing without content or without context (this is important now that we allow you to specify context).

All attributes of parameters are required to keep blank/improper parameters from being created/retained.

Parameters now have two id attributes: `IOCParameter/@id` is a unique GUID to identify the parameter, and `IOCParameter/@ref-id` is used to show which element inside the IOC that specific parameter refers to.

If you use a Link in the IOC metadata, the `rel` attribute is now required (i.e. there must actually be a link represented in the IOC xml, even if it is empty).

The behavior of `IndicatorItem/@preserve-case` should only apply to strings.  The table below states whether or not the given preserve-case value (true or false) is acceptable for a given content type.

    ```
                   String  Md5sum  IPAddr  Integer DateTime Bool  Float
    true            yes     no      no      no      no       no    no
    false           yes     yes     yes     yes     yes      yes   yes
    ```

The case sensitivity of a regular expression match, where `IndicatorItem/@condition='matches'`, should be determined by the `IndicatorItem/@preserve-case` term.

By default, the `IndicatorItem/@preserve-case` attribute should be set to 'false' when creating a IndicatorItem.
